# KU-Project2-Pentest

This was project was quite interesting as we performed a Penetration test in a 3 day CTF style event where each day was
dedicated to testing a seperate part of the fictional Rekall Corporation's assets.

The first day, we tested it's Web Application.  The second day, we tested the Linux OS machines in the network.  
The third day, we tested the Windows OS machines in the network.

We found and exploited multiple vulnerablities in all of these systems and then completed a penetration testing 
summary report explaining our findings, recommended mitigations and new best security practices.  

Our team, that I was the captain of, did happen to place 1st overall after the 3 day event as well.
